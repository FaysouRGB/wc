## Overview

This tool is a recreation of the UNIX wc command. It reads text from files or standard input and displays counts for characters, lines, and words. It supports multiple files and will display each one on its line as well as a total for each category.

## Key Features

- Count characters (`-c`)
- Count lines (`-l`)
- Count words (`-w`)
- Support for multiple files
- Displays totals for each category

## Limitations and Known Issues

- The tool does not handle all wc flags.

## Usage and Testing

To test the tool, you should first run the make command. The wc executable will be located in the build folder. You can the run it using this pattern:

```bash
./wc [OPTIONS] [FILES...]
```
